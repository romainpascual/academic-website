abstract: Implementing new operations for geometric modeling is often a difficult task when they can be simply described from a sketch or an example. We propose a method to infer operations via a representative example. The inference mechanism exploits the regularity of generalized maps and Jerboa's rule-based language for topology reconstruction. For the reconstruction of the geometric computations, we handle the problem of the geometric positions of the vertices as a constraint satisfaction problem.
