title: [Information Systems and Programming](https://centralesupelec.edunao.com/course/view.php?id=3447)

summary: The SIP course is intended to educate future engineers to understand and master the IT tools and information systems they will be confronted with in their career, as well as build their skills to properly design and write code. The course is composed of two main parts, Information Systems and Programming, the second focusing on the Python language.

*Teaching time performed:* 25.5 hours of tutorials

*Instructors:* [Gianluca Quercini](https://gquercini.github.io/)

*Student level:* First year (~BSCS)

Three courses help students to boost their skills in programming and algorithmic. SIP is the first, followed by two weeks of intense programming (Coding Weeks) and the Algorithmic & Complexity course. 1st year students have very different levels in these fields, depending on their previous scholastic path (prep classes including “MP Option Info”, other universities, ...) and their personal taste for programming (some have already participated in programming contests). This course does not require any advanced notion in algorithmic. However, all students must reach a minimum common level; the most advanced students will have the chance to further improve their skills.

At the end of the three courses, students will have the necessary coding skills to cope with other courses at CentraleSupélec, develop tools for student clubs on campus and companies.
