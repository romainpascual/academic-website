Game theory is the formal study of the interactions between rational agents defined by the objectives they seek to achieve and by their strategic options. Strategies can potentially be interdependent (i.e. situations in which the issue for each participant depends not only on the decisions they make, but also on the decisions made by other participants). In this course, we will deal more specifically with the computational approach to games, which is based on computer models of game situations (state and graph models, constraint models, etc.) and which aims to automate the search for strategies and analyze their performance (optimality). This course will cover the theory and practice of finding optimal and satisfying solutions for multi-player combinatorial games, such as popular games such as Soduku,Sokoban, Othello, Checkers, etc. It will include the following points. The relevant representation of information, intelligent decision-making (i.e. satisfactory, quasi-optimal or optimal), modelling of action sequences, taking into account paiements and uncertainties and capitalizing on experience, aggregation of conflicting preferences, algorithms for routing combinatorial game spaces.
