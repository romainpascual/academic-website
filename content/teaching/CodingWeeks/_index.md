The coding weeks are a mini programming boot camp which aims, through the realization of computer development projects, to allow students to consolidate their knowledge in programming and development of computer applications on the one hand and on the other hand to learn about the practices and methodologies of computer development in groups. This activity also allows students to learn and acquire, mainly through practice, the fundamentals of the culture of quality of computer code ("software craftsmanship").

**Teaching time performed:** 78 hours (once on the project "Gamejam" and once on the project "Open source code and learning games for coding").

Part of the teaching team for the school years 2019-2020 and 2020-2021.

**Instructors:** [CÃ©line Hudelot](http://perso.ecp.fr/~hudelotc/).

**Student level:** First year (~BSCS).

This activity is organized in two consecutive weeks of software development.

During the first week, students work in groups of 4 to 5 on the development of a typical project organized in different progressive iterations (sprints). Methodological and technical contributions are also provided in the form of lectures or tutorials (version management, APIs, test driven development and code quality) and implemented during the development of this typical project.

During the second week, the students work, in groups of 4 to 5, on a thematic project with the objective of going from the idea to the product. The aim is to implement the methodologies and practices of computer development acquired previously.
