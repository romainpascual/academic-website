title: [Theoretical Computer Science](https://centralesupelec.edunao.com/course/view.php?id=4697)

summary: This teaching gives a part of the fundamentals of computer science on its two paradigms of computation, which are reduction (calculation step by step) and resolution (logical inference / automatic reasoning)

type: teaching

*Teaching time performed:* 6 hours of tutorials and 3 hours of practical classes in Coq

*Instructors:* [Marc Aiguier](http://perso.ecp.fr/~aiguierm/) and [Pascale Le Gall](https://research.centralesupelec.fr/pascale.legall/)

*Student level:* Second year (~MCS)

Part of this elective course overlaps with the courses [Logic modeling and formal systems]({{< relref "/teaching/LanguageAutomata/_index.md" >}}) and [Logic modeling and formal systems]({{< relref "/teaching/ModLog/_index.md" >}}), mandatory courses for the computer science major in third year.

Syllabus

The course addresses the following fundamental notions:

- Induction and recurrence (well-founded sets, etc).
- Computability (GÃ¶del/Herbrand's recursive functions, Turing machines and all the associated indecidability results).
- Mathematical logic (syntax, semantics and proof systems). Propositional and first-order logics will be detailed.
