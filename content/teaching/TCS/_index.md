This course presents some of the fundamentals of computer science on its two paradigms of computation, namely reduction (calculation step by step) and resolution (logical inference / automatic reasoning).

**Teaching time performed:** 6 hours of tutorials and 3 hours of practical classes in Coq

Part of the teaching team for the school year 2021-2022.

**Instructors:** [Marc Aiguier](http://perso.ecp.fr/~aiguierm/) and [Pascale Le Gall](https://research.centralesupelec.fr/pascale.legall/)

**Student level:** Second year (~MCS)

Part of this elective course overlaps with the courses [Logic modeling and formal systems]({{< relref "/teaching/LanguageAutomata/_index.md" >}}) and [Logic modeling and formal systems]({{< relref "/teaching/ModLog/_index.md" >}}), mandatory courses for the computer science major in third year.

Syllabus:

- Induction and recurrence (well-founded sets, etc).
- Computability (GÃ¶del/Herbrand's recursive functions, Turing machines and all the associated indecidability results).
- Mathematical logic (syntax, semantics and proof systems). Propositional and first-order logics are be detailed.
