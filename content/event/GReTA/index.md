abstract: In the first part of the talk, I will present generalized maps that
  represent quasi-manifolds through their subdivision into topological cells
  (vertices,edges, faces, volumes). We defined generalized maps as constrained
  labeled graphs. Arc labels encode topological relations of the subparts of the
  modeled object, while node labels describe the geometric data used to
  represent the object. Modeling operations are designed regardless of the
  object’s underlying topology. Therefore, we generalize DPO rules with a
  functorial approach to encode semi-global relabeling with a product operation.
  Rules and their extensions (called rule schemes) are considered valid if any
  application to a well-formed graph results in an equally well-formed graph. We
  provide set-theoric conditions on rules and rule schemes to ensure the
  preservation of the model consistency. In the second part of the talk, I will
  present how this approach allows the design of geometric modelers (software
  used to create and edit geometric objects) in Jerboa. The set-theoric
  conditions can be checked via graph traversal in Jerboa’s rule editor to
  ensure that the code derived from the rule will never break the model. The
  generated code can be used as an add-on in other software or Jerboa’s generic
  viewer.
